# EDCCPersonalSite
My Edmonds Community College personal website (built from scratch.)

The creation of this site was for a finals assignment in my first 
quarter at Edmonds Community College, for my Web Developer Certificate.
This site was created completely from scratch using HTML and CSS. I use
Visual Studio Code as my editing platform. The UI was created on an iPad
in Microsoft OneNote and the graphics were copied and isolated with 
SnagIt. 

Feel free to reach out to me at timothytrimble@me.com if you have any
comments or questions.
