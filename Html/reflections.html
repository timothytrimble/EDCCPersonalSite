	<p>
	As a software developer with over 35 years of experience (Yeah, I'm old,) I have always 
	focused on the desktop-based methodologies for software design and programming. I've done 
	some basic HTML, some light javascript, and I thought I understood the concept behind CSS. 
	In fact, in my last job, I spent a lot of time troubleshooting issues with a very complex 
	web-based system that incorporated HTML, CSS, Javascript, JSON, C#, Angular, with an MS 
	SQL and PostgreSQL backend. I could read the code and troubleshoot enough to describe and 
	assign issues to the development team.
	</p>
	<p>
	For my public-facing website, I used a sophisticated GUI, provided by the ISP, for building 
	the site and adding content. I used to feel a sense of pride when people asked me who made 
	my website, and I replied, "I did." However, after diving into the certificate course for 
	web development at Edmonds Community College, I can genuinely say I was missing a 
	significant portion of understanding about website development.
	</p>
	<p>
	In my early days as a game developer, I learned how to write assembly language. I was able 
	to acquire an understanding of how computers worked, how a CPU truly worked, how memory is 
	addressed, and the differences between hardware, software, and firmware. It was an 
	excellent foundation of knowledge to have when writing C/C++ code for desktops and 
	especially for mobile devices.
	</p>	
	<p>
	To have a full understanding of how websites function, how cloud networking technology is 
	changing information management, and how web-based applications are replacing local 
	software - one needs to have a "full-stack" understanding of web development. Thankfully, 
	this web development course is bringing me back into the market as a certified web developer.
